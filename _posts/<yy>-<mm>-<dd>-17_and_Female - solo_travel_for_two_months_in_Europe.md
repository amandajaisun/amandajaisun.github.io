Here's my 2-month tour with 1 backpack in Europe, challenges I faced, and how you can plan this trip yourself .
Budapest, the most beautiful city in the world.The past summer, I spent 57 days in the Schengen area. My destinations included Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin, Budapest, Ljubljana, Florence, and Nice.
My itinerary was flexible. I had a return flight, 1-month Eurrail Pass, and booked hostels for Paris and London. My destinations were not set in stone; Ljubljana and Florence were not originally on my list, but due to companions I met and people who raved about those places, I added them on.

The Challenges
By far, the most worrisome problem of my journey was my age. Many hostels in Europe either refuse entry to those under 18, or require them to stay in a private room. As I was under 18 and on a budget/looking for travel companions, both situations were best avoided.
Coming from America, I've grown up in a culture where age restrictions are strictly enforced. Receiving alcohol in a restaurant could risk big trouble for the establishment, and my age has prevented me from signing up for some educational courses. So I was very surprised when I was accepted to the first hostel without a glance. I had prepared beforehand - intending to look older, I arrived at their reception sporting pearl earrings and sunglasses, props that I had hoped in desperation would add some years to my face. I handed the hostel worker my passport with sweaty hands, watched as he performed a cursory scan, and breathed an internal sigh of relief when he handed it back with my room key. OK. Hurdle one passed.
*However, I later found that established chain hostels would catch my age. It did not happen in my first scenario because the hostel didn't have any branches. St. Christopher's Inn and PLUS Hostels, both very popular across Europe, both caught me, but the former had a nice hostel worker that let me stay since I only booked 1 night, and the latter let me pass with a parental consent form stating I am allowed to travel by myself, which I had printed out before my trip.
When I walked up to my room, I was greeted with clean bed sheets and 7 other roommates. None of them were remotely close to my age. The youngest-looking woman that I was talking with turned out to be in her 30s. As the week passed, I experienced the main difficulty that other solo travelers worried about: loneliness. It was isolating to be 17, and Ithis led to homesickness. My craving for Chinese and American food was barely alleviated by home cooked ramen made from scavenged hostel food. Most meals consisted of 3 euro gyros, ironically the most common European street food.
To solve this problem, I booked a Chinese Airbnb in Budapest (yes, you heard that right) that promised authentic Northern Chinese meals and a welcoming family. Although the host's family felt just like home, telling me to "stay safe! have fun!" and jesting about my bad Chinese, and the food comfortingly home cooked, what I really needed were younger travelers I could relate to. That moment appeared when I met an 18 and 19 German and Danish girl at the Szechenyi Baths and struck up a conversation. The girls had both won a Eurail pass and met each other on a Facebook group for the winners.
The irony that the best Chinese food I've had outside of China was in EuropeAs we got along quite well and were in similar situations, I felt safe telling them that I was 17. The two relieved another worry of mine - being turned away from dance clubs. With them, I was introduced to a whole new way of traveling, and after going to my first club and many more after, I realized that no one cares about your age here.
Through clubs, I found a whole world of young travelers. Although none of them were ever my age, there were plenty of college-aged students who I got along with. The people were amazing, from a 21-year old New Zealand philosopher pursuing a PhD to Germans hitchhiking and couch surfing to abandoned churches in Europe, sleeping in hammocks in the woods at night. These people would become my travel companions and friends.
Solo travel is surprisingly social!Hurdle two, check.
And then, racism. I'll leave that for another post.
Ultimately, the trip was unforgettable. I made lifelong friends, developed more independence (what to do? cook? where to SLEEP?), learned to be both wary and trusting of strangers. I'd do it again, and plan to (I'm lookin' at you, Asia)!

The Plan
Now that you know the trip was worth it, here's how to plan your own.
Transportation:
Internationally, I used google flights to find the cheapest tickets to Europe. The cheapest I found were from WOWAir, an Icelandic airline which always has a layover is Reykjavik, at $300 for two-way SF to Paris. I would book a flight with a longer layover so you can explore Reykjavik, which has great outdoor baths.
Within Europe, I used a Eurrail pass when I could squeeze many trips within 24 hours, and Flixbus when I wanted wifi and reliability. Flixbus ruled in so many ways. It was cheaper, even if I booked only a day ahead. It was reliable, and didn't have transfers (I'm lookin' at you, Italian trains!).
Also check out Provost and Blablacar, two rideshare companies that I did not use but heard a lot about.
In cities, I just walked or used the metro. It's quite easy to learn, and locals are always willing to help out!
Accomodation:
I used Airbnb for popular cities like Paris and London where there was a dearth of local hostels. The prices were quite decent if you stayed a week per location, because per booking there is a service/cleaning fee, and 7-day stays often give discounts.
Hostels were cheaper and more sociable. They usually come with a communal kitchen and a "free food" section where departing travelers leave uneaten food. This was super useful as a traveler on a budget! Also, as a solo traveler it was important just to have some human interaction every day. Plus, hostels have so much information about the local area and sometimes walking tours. I recommend checking out Hostelworld.
Gotta budget for snacks - try Prince in Europe for the classic choco cookie!Budget
Cooking was always cheaper and healthier. Beans and rice are full of energy and super cheap! Gyros are also a great alternative. I always made sure to eat at least one traditional meal in a new country, and it doesn't need to be expensive! In Florence, the best food I had came from a 3 euro buffet, superior to the 15 euro pasta I ate later in a restaurant lauded on TripAdvisor and Yelp.

The best gyros at the price of 5 chicken nuggets.I never bought souvenirs. You can find out why here.
My first day in a new city was just walking around. I'd find shops or statues or areas that caught my eye, mark them on google maps, and return later.
Free walking tours are very very legitimate. Don't forget to tip at the end!
If you're strapped for cash, try working remotely as a contractor while traveling. I did some design freelance work on the computer I brought.

Aftermath
Two months of traveling was enough for me. Although I savored my last few days in Paris, I was eager to return home. Looking back, I could say that I progressed on my goals to become a more independent and empathetic citizen.
Although I bought no souvenirs, I took home precious memories and lessons from this trip. From talking to homeless Romanians to exploring the gilded halls of the Palace of Versailles, the singular moments are the only things I wish to preserve, each memory like a crumpled and recrumpled photograph fading with the passage of time.
