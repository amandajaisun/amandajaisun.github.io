Some information about you!

### More Information

I'm a designer, thinker, and Wednesday-evening swing dancer. 
Also a Dartmouth '23 taking a gap year! Currently, I'm interning at an organic sourdough formation in southern France, and in the past I've launched a successful [Kickstarter for recyclable cards](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1372918543/cheer-up-cards-for-everyone) and wrote a [body-positivity coloring book](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Body-Positivity-Coloring-Book/dp/1977784895) used by a couple hospitals around the country.
